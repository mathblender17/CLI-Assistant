üìä Dynamic Evaluation Report (eval\_dynamic.md)
===============================================

**Date:** 2025-06-18**Model:** LLaMA (with LoRA adapter)**Task:** Git CLI Instruction Following**Evaluation Type:** Dynamic (Live Response Generation)

‚öôÔ∏è Runtime Warnings & Environment Logs
--------------------------------------

During the model execution, several backend logs were recorded:

*   Multiple warnings from TensorFlow regarding:
    
    *   cuFFT, cuBLAS, cuDNN plugins being registered multiple times.
        
    *   AVX2, AVX512F, and FMA CPU instructions not enabled ‚Äî suggesting a custom TF build for full optimization.
        
*   All initial logs redirected to STDERR before absl::InitializeLog().
    
*   No critical errors during model load, but some sessions ended in a **KeyboardInterrupt** (likely due to timeout or manual stop).

‚ùå Failures & Observations
-------------------------

*   **Repetition in CUDA errors:** Seen in every generation attempt due to plugin factory conflicts.
    
*   **Multiple "No shell command detected" flags:** The model failed to detect CLI commands consistently, despite them being present.
    
*   **Response Quality:**
    
    *   Responses were mostly incomplete or cut off.
        
    *   Some answers used incorrect Git flags (-m instead of checkout -b, etc.).
        
    *   Many outputs mixed shell commands with GUI instructions.
        
*   **Interruptions:** One run ended prematurely due to a KeyboardInterrupt.

‚úÖ Suggested Improvements
------------------------

*   üîÅ Improve instruction-following alignment (e.g., by fine-tuning on Git CLI tasks specifically).
    
*   üß™ Implement better shell command formatting detection (identify prompt vs explanation).
    
*   üìâ Address model stalling (e.g., avoid keyboard interrupts via proper timeout settings).
    
*   üõ†Ô∏è Add fallback strategies for long prompts or ambiguous CLI vs GUI instructions.
