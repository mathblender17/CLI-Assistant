üìä Static Evaluation: Base vs Fine-Tuned CLI Agent
==================================================

This evaluation compares the outputs of the base and fine-tuned models on 5 CLI prompts, assessing answer quality using BLEU, ROUGE, and quality scores.

### üîç Summary

ModelAvg BLEUAvg ROUGEAvg QualityBase~0.0027~0.11590.0Tuned~0.0069~0.06320.0

**Insight:**The base model shows marginally better BLEU/ROUGE scores in most cases, but both struggle with maintaining quality responses. Some tuned outputs are missing or irrelevant (e.g., logging out instead of providing CLI advice).
