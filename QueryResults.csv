<h2>Delete Remote Branch [Original Answer from 5-Jan-2010]</h2>
<p>From Chapter 3 of <a href=""http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Remote-Branches"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>Pro Git</em></a> by Scott Chacon:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Deleting Remote Branches</h3>
<p>Suppose you’re done with a remote branch — say, you and your collaborators are finished with a feature and have merged it into your remote’s main branch (or whatever branch your stable code-line is in). You can delete a remote branch using the rather obtuse syntax <code>git push [remotename] :[branch]</code>. If you want to delete your <code>serverfix</code> branch from the server, you run the following:</p>
<pre><code>$ git push origin :serverfix
To git@github.com:schacon/simplegit.git
 - [deleted]         serverfix
</code></pre>
<p>Boom. No more branches on your server. You may want to dog-ear this page, because you’ll need that command, and you’ll likely forget the syntax. A way to remember this command is by recalling the <code>git push [remotename] [localbranch]:[remotebranch]</code> syntax that we went over a bit earlier. If you leave off the <code>[localbranch]</code> portion, then you’re basically saying, “Take nothing on my side and make it be <code>[remotebranch]</code>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I ran <code>git push origin :bugfix</code>, and it worked beautifully. Scott Chacon was right—I will want to <a href=""http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dogear#Verb"" rel=""noreferrer"">dog-ear</a> that page (or virtually dog ear-by answering this on Stack Overflow).</p>
<h1>Fetch changes</h1>
<p>Finally, execute the following on other machines to propagate changes:</p>
<pre><code># Fetch changes from all remotes and locally delete 
# remote deleted branches/tags etc
# --prune will do the job :-;
git fetch --all --prune

"1783405","How to check out a remote Git branch?","<p>How do I check out the remote <code>test</code> branch? I can see it with <code>git branch -r</code>. I tried:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>git checkout test</code>, which does nothing</li>
<li><code>git checkout origin/test</code> gives <code>* (no branch)</code></li>
</ul>
","<git><git-checkout><remote-branch>","1783426","<p>The answer has been split depending on whether there is one remote repository configured or multiple. The reason for this is that for the single remote case, some of the commands can be simplified as there is less ambiguity.</p>
<p><strong>Updated for Git 2.23:</strong> For older versions, see the section at the end.</p>
<h2>With One Remote</h2>
<p>In both cases, start by fetching from the remote repository to make sure you have all the latest changes downloaded.</p>
<pre><code>$ git fetch
</code></pre>
<p>This will fetch all of the remote branches for you. You can see the branches available for checkout with:</p>
<pre><code>$ git branch -v -a

...
remotes/origin/test
</code></pre>
<p>The branches that start with <code>remotes/*</code> can be thought of as read only copies of the remote branches. To work on a branch you need to create a local branch from it. This is done with the Git command <code>switch</code> (since Git 2.23) by giving it the name of the remote branch (minus the remote name):</p>
<pre><code>$ git switch test
</code></pre>
<p>In this case Git is guessing (can be disabled with <code>--no-guess</code>) that you are trying to checkout and track the remote branch with the same name.</p>
<h2>With Multiple Remotes</h2>
<p>In the case where multiple remote repositories exist, the remote repository needs to be explicitly named.</p>
<p>As before, start by fetching the latest remote changes:</p>
<pre><code>$ git fetch origin
</code></pre>
<p>This will fetch all of the remote branches for you. You can see the branches available for checkout with:</p>
<pre><code>$ git branch -v -a
</code></pre>
<p>With the remote branches in hand, you now need to check out the branch you are interested in with <code>-c</code> to create a new local branch:</p>
<pre><code>$ git switch -c test origin/test
</code></pre>
<p>For more information about using <code>git switch</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ man git-switch
</code></pre>
<h2>Prior to Git 2.23</h2>
<p><code>git switch</code> was added in Git 2.23, prior to this <code>git checkout</code> was used to switch branches.</p>
<p>To checkout out with only a single remote repository:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout test
</code></pre>
<p>if there are multiple remote repositories configured then it becomes a bit longer</p>

<p>However, according to the official <a href=""https://git-scm.com/docs/git-update-index"" rel=""noreferrer"">git documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Users often try to use the assume-unchanged and skip-worktree bits to tell Git to ignore changes to files that are tracked. This does not work as expected, since Git may still check working tree files against the index when performing certain operations. In general, Git does not provide a way to ignore changes to tracked files, so alternate solutions are recommended.</p>

<p><strong>WARNING: This will remove the physical file from your local machine and other developers' machines on your or their next <code>git pull</code>.</strong></p>

<h2><a href=""https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clean"" rel=""noreferrer"">git-clean</a> - Remove untracked files from the working tree</h2>
<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<pre><code>git clean [-d] [-f] [-i] [-n] [-q] [-e &lt;pattern&gt;] [-x | -X] [--] &lt;path&gt;…​
</code></pre>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Cleans the working tree by recursively removing files that are not under version control, <strong>starting from the current directory</strong>.</p>
<p>Normally, only files unknown to Git are removed, but if the <code>-x</code> option is specified, ignored files are also removed. This can, for example, be useful to remove all build products.</p>
<p>If any optional <code>&lt;path&gt;...</code> arguments are given, only those paths are affected.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Step 1 is to show what will be deleted by using the <code>-n</code> option:</p>

<pre class=""lang-bash prettyprint-override""><code># Print out the list of files and directories which will be removed (dry run)
git clean -n -d
</code></pre>
<p>Clean Step - <strong>beware: this will delete files</strong>:</p>
<pre class=""lang-bash prettyprint-override""><code># Delete the files from the repository
git clean -f
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>To remove directories, run <code>git clean -f -d</code> or <code>git clean -fd</code></li>
<li>To remove ignored files, run <code>git clean -f -X</code> or <code>git clean -fX</code></li>
<li>To remove ignored and non-ignored files, run <code>git clean -f -x</code> or <code>git clean -fx</code></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong> the case difference on the <code>X</code> for the two latter commands.</p>
<p>If <code>clean.requireForce</code> is set to &quot;true&quot; (the default) in your configuration, one needs to specify <code>-f</code> otherwise nothing will actually happen.</p>
<p>Again see the <a href=""http://git-scm.com/docs/git-clean"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>git-clean</code></a> docs for more information.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<h3>Options</h3>
<p><strong><code>-f</code>, <code>--force</code></strong></p>
<p>If the Git configuration variable clean.requireForce is not set to
false, git clean will refuse to run unless given <code>-f</code>, <code>-n</code> or <code>-i</code>.</p>
<p><strong><code>-x</code></strong></p>
<p>Don’t use the standard ignore rules read from .gitignore (per
directory) and <code>$GIT_DIR/info/exclude</code>, but do still use the ignore
rules given with <code>-e</code> options. This allows removing all untracked files,
including build products. This can be used (possibly in conjunction
with git reset) to create a pristine working directory to test a clean
build.</p>
<p><strong><code>-X</code></strong></p>
<p>Remove only files ignored by Git. This may be useful to rebuild
everything from scratch, but keep manually created files.</p>
<p><strong><code>-n</code>, <code>--dry-run</code></strong></p>
<p>Don’t actually remove anything, just show what would be done.</p>
<p><strong><code>-d</code></strong></p>
<p>Remove untracked directories in addition to untracked files. If an
untracked directory is managed by a different Git repository, it is
not removed by default. Use <code>-f</code> option twice if you really want to
remove such a directory.</p>

<p>…however, this can make multi-line commit messages or small corrections more cumbersome to enter.</p>
<p>Make sure you don't have any working copy changes <em>staged</em> before doing this or they will get committed too. (<em>Unstaged</em> changes will not get committed.)</p>
<h2>Changing the message of a commit that you've already pushed to your remote branch</h2>
<p>If you've already pushed your commit up to your remote branch, then - after amending your commit locally (as described above) - you'll also <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41003071/why-must-i-force-push-after-changing-a-commit-message"">need to force push the commit</a> with:</p>
<pre class=""lang-bash prettyprint-override""><code>git push &lt;remote&gt; &lt;branch&gt; --force
# Or
git push &lt;remote&gt; &lt;branch&gt; -f
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Warning: force-pushing will overwrite the remote branch with the state of your local one</strong>. If there are commits on the remote branch that you don't have in your local branch, you <em>will</em> lose those commits.</p>
<p><strong>Warning: be cautious about amending commits that you have already shared with other people.</strong> Amending commits essentially <em>rewrites</em> them to have different <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1"" rel=""noreferrer"">SHA</a> IDs, which poses a problem if other people have copies of the old commit that you've rewritten. Anyone who has a copy of the old commit will need to synchronize their work with your newly re-written commit, which can sometimes be difficult, so make sure you coordinate with others when attempting to rewrite shared commit history, or just avoid rewriting shared commits altogether.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Perform an interactive rebase</h3>
<p>Another option is to use interactive rebase.
This allows you to edit any message you want to update even if it's not the latest message.</p>
<p>In order to do a Git squash, follow these steps:</p>
<pre><code>// n is the number of commits up to the last commit you want to be able to edit
git rebase -i HEAD~n
</code></pre>
<p>Once you squash your commits - choose the <code>e/r</code> for editing the message:</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/LVcm9.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/LVcm9.png"" alt=""Screenshot of terminal while editing commit"" /></a></p>
<h3>Important note about interactive rebase</h3>
<p>When you use <code>git rebase -i HEAD~n</code> there can be <strong>more</strong> than n commits. Git will &quot;collect&quot; all the commits in the last n commits, and if there was a merge somewhere in between that range you will see all the commits as well, so the outcome will be n + .</p>
<h3>Good tip:</h3>
<p>If you have to do it for more than a single branch and you might face conflicts when amending the content, set up <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35415925/is-it-possible-to-setup-git-merge-for-automatic-resolving-git-rerere/35417944#35417944""><code>git rerere</code></a> and let Git resolve those conflicts automatically for you.</p>

<p>How do I revert to the commit from November 3, i.e. commit <code>0d1d7fc</code>?</p>
","<git><git-checkout><git-reset><git-revert>","4114122","<p>This depends a lot on what you mean by &quot;revert&quot;.</p>
<h2>Temporarily switch to a different commit</h2>
<p>If you want to temporarily go back to it, fool around, then come back to where you are, all you have to do is check out the desired commit:</p>
<pre class=""lang-sh prettyprint-override""><code># This will detach your HEAD, that is, leave you with no branch checked out:
git checkout 0d1d7fc32
</code></pre>
<p>Or if you want to make commits while you're there, go ahead and make a new branch while you're at it:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout -b old-state 0d1d7fc32
</code></pre>
<p>To go back to where you were, just check out the branch you were on again. (If you've made changes, as always when switching branches, you'll have to deal with them as appropriate. You could reset to throw them away; you could stash, checkout, stash pop to take them with you; you could commit them to a branch there if you want a branch there.)</p>
<h2>Hard delete unpublished commits</h2>
<p>If, on the other hand, you want to really get rid of everything you've done since then, there are two possibilities. One, if you haven't published any of these commits, simply reset:</p>
<pre class=""lang-sh prettyprint-override""><code># This will destroy any local modifications.
# Don't do it if you have uncommitted work you want to keep.
git reset --hard 0d1d7fc32

# Alternatively, if there's work to keep:
git stash
git reset --hard 0d1d7fc32
git stash pop
# This saves the modifications, then reapplies that patch after resetting.
# You could get merge conflicts, if you've modified things which were
# changed since the commit you reset to.
</code></pre>
<p>If you mess up, you've already thrown away your local changes, but you can at least get back to where you were before by resetting again.</p>
<h2>Undo published commits with new commits</h2>
<p>On the other hand, if you've published the work, you probably don't want to reset the branch, since that's effectively rewriting history. In that case, you could indeed revert the commits. In many enterprise organisations, the concept of &quot;protected&quot; branches will even prevent history from being rewritten on some major branches. In this case, reverting is your only option.</p>
<p>With Git, revert has a very specific meaning: create a commit with the reverse patch to cancel it out. This way you don't rewrite any history.</p>
<p>First figure out what commits to revert. Depending on the technique chosen below, you want to either revert only the merge commits, or only the non-merge commits.</p>

<pre><code># This lists all merge commits between 0d1d7fc and HEAD:
git log --merges --pretty=format:&quot;%h&quot; 0d1d7fc..HEAD | tr '\n' ' '

# This lists all non merge commits between 0d1d7fc and HEAD:
git log --no-merges --pretty=format:&quot;%h&quot; 0d1d7fc..HEAD | tr '\n' ' '
</code></pre>
<p>Note: if you revert multiple commits, the order matters. Start with the most recent commit.</p>
<pre class=""lang-sh prettyprint-override""><code># This will create three separate revert commits, use non merge commits only:
git revert a867b4af 25eee4ca 0766c053

# It also takes ranges. This will revert the last two commits:
git revert HEAD~2..HEAD

# Similarly, you can revert a range of commits using commit hashes (non inclusive of first hash):
git revert 0d1d7fc..a867b4a

# Reverting a merge commit. You can also use a range of merge commits here.
git revert -m 1 &lt;merge_commit_sha&gt;

# To get just one, you could use `rebase -i` to squash them afterwards
# Or, you could do it manually (be sure to do this at top level of the repo)
# get your index and work tree into the desired state, without changing HEAD:
git checkout 0d1d7fc32 .

# Then commit. Be sure and write a good message describing what you just did
git commit

<h2>Moving to an existing branch</h2>
<p>If you want to move your commits to an <strong>existing branch</strong>, it will look like this:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout existingbranch
git merge branchToMoveCommitFrom
git checkout branchToMoveCommitFrom
git reset --hard HEAD~3 # Go back 3 commits. You *will* lose uncommitted work.
git checkout existingbranch
</code></pre>
<h2>Moving to a new branch</h2>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> This method works because you are creating a new branch with the first command: <code>git branch newbranch</code>. If you want to move commits to an <strong>existing branch</strong> you need to merge your changes into the existing branch before executing <code>git reset --hard HEAD~3</code> (see <em><strong>Moving to an existing branch</strong></em> above). <strong>If you don't merge your changes first, they will be lost.</strong></p>
<p>Unless there are other circumstances involved, this can be easily done by branching and rolling back.</p>

<pre class=""lang-sh prettyprint-override""><code># Note: Any changes not committed will be lost.
git branch newbranch      # Create a new branch, saving the desired commits
git checkout master       # checkout master, this is the place you want to go back
git reset --hard HEAD~3   # Move master back by 3 commits (Make sure you know how many commits you need to go back)
git checkout newbranch    # Go to the new branch that still has the desired commits
</code></pre>
<p>But do make sure how many commits to go back. Alternatively, you can instead of <code>HEAD~3</code>, simply provide the hash of the commit (or the reference like <em>origin/master</em>) you want to &quot;revert back to&quot; on the <em>master</em> (/current) branch, e.g:</p>
<pre class=""lang-sh prettyprint-override""><code>git reset --hard a1b2c3d4
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You will <strong>only</strong> be &quot;losing&quot; commits from the master branch, but don't worry, you'll have those commits in newbranch! An easy way to check that, after completing the 4 step sequence of commands above, is by looking at <code>git log -n4</code> which will show the history of newbranch actually retained the 3 commits (and the reason is that newbranch was created at the time those changes were already commited on master!). They have only been removed from master, as <code>git reset</code> only affected the branch that was checked out at the time of its execution, i.e. master (see <a href=""https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reset"" rel=""noreferrer"">git reset</a> description: <em>Reset <strong>current</strong> HEAD to the specified state</em>). <code>git status</code> however will not show any checkouts on the newbranch, which might be surprising at first but that is actually expected.</p>
<p>Lastly, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1628563/move-the-most-recent-commits-to-a-new-branch-with-git#comment42808558_6796816"">you may need</a> to force push your latest changes to main repo:</p>
<pre class=""lang-sh prettyprint-override""><code>git push origin master --force
</code></pre>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> With Git version 2.0 and later, if you later <code>git rebase</code> the new branch upon the original (<code>master</code>) branch, you may need an explicit <code>--no-fork-point</code> option during the rebase to avoid losing the carried-over commits.  Having <code>branch.autosetuprebase always</code> set makes this more likely.  See <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/36463546/1256452"">John Mellor's answer</a> for details.</p>

<p>is a useful one-liner which will give you the full directory name of the script no matter where it is being called from.</p>
<p>It will work as long as the last component of the path used to find the script is not a symlink (directory links are OK).  If you also want to resolve any links to the script itself, you need a multi-line solution:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash

    local SCRIPT_DIR
    # Resolve symlinks recursively

        # Get symlink directory
        SYMLINK_DIR=&quot;$( cd -P &quot;$( dirname &quot;$SOURCE_PATH&quot; )&quot; &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;&amp; pwd )&quot;

    SCRIPT_DIR=&quot;$(cd -P &quot;$( dirname &quot;$SOURCE_PATH&quot; )&quot; &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;&amp; pwd)&quot;
    echo &quot;$SCRIPT_DIR&quot;
}

echo &quot;get_script_dir: $(get_script_dir)&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>This last one will work with any combination of aliases, <code>source</code>, <code>bash -c</code>, symlinks, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Beware:</strong> if you <code>cd</code> to a different directory before running this snippet, the result may be incorrect!</p>
<p>Also, watch out for <a href=""http://bosker.wordpress.com/2012/02/12/bash-scripters-beware-of-the-cdpath/"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>$CDPATH</code> gotchas</a>, and stderr output side effects if the user has smartly overridden cd to redirect output to stderr instead (including escape sequences, such as when calling <code>update_terminal_cwd &gt;&amp;2</code> on Mac). Adding <code>&gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1</code> at the end of your <code>cd</code> command will take care of both possibilities.</p>
<p>To understand how it works, try running this more verbose form:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash

SOURCE=${BASH_SOURCE[0]}
while [ -L &quot;$SOURCE&quot; ]; do # resolve $SOURCE until the file is no longer a symlink
  TARGET=$(readlink &quot;$SOURCE&quot;)
  if [[ $TARGET == /* ]]; then
    echo &quot;SOURCE '$SOURCE' is an absolute symlink to '$TARGET'&quot;
    SOURCE=$TARGET
  else
    DIR=$( dirname &quot;$SOURCE&quot; )
    echo &quot;SOURCE '$SOURCE' is a relative symlink to '$TARGET' (relative to '$DIR')&quot;
    SOURCE=$DIR/$TARGET # if $SOURCE was a relative symlink, we need to resolve it relative to the path where the symlink file was located
  fi
done
echo &quot;SOURCE is '$SOURCE'&quot;
RDIR=$( dirname &quot;$SOURCE&quot; )
DIR=$( cd -P &quot;$( dirname &quot;$SOURCE&quot; )&quot; &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;&amp; pwd )

  echo &quot;DIR '$RDIR' resolves to '$DIR'&quot;

","<git><git-tag>","5480292","<p>You can push an 'empty' reference to the remote tag name:</p>

<p>Or, more expressively, use the <code>--delete</code> option (or <code>-d</code> if your git version is older than 1.8.0):</p>
<pre><code>git push --delete origin tagname
</code></pre>
<p>Note that git has tag namespace and branch namespace so you may use the same name for a branch and for a tag. If you want to make sure that you cannot accidentally remove the branch instead of the tag, you can specify full ref which will never delete a branch:</p>
<pre><code>git push origin :refs/tags/tagname

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Pushing a branch, tag, or other ref to a remote repository involves specifying &quot;which repo, what source, what destination?&quot;</p>
<pre><code>git push remote-repo source-ref:destination-ref

<p>A real world example where you push your master branch to the origin's master branch is:</p>

<pre><code>git push origin master:master

<p>Tags work the same way:</p>
<pre><code>git push origin refs/tags/release-1.0:refs/tags/release-1.0

<p>Which can also be shortened to:</p>
<pre><code>git push origin release-1.0:release-1.0

<p>This takes care if the (de)initialization steps (<code>.git/config</code> and <code>.git/modules/xxx</code>)</p>

<li>checkout the commit parent to both of the branches</li>
<li>create and checkout a temporary branch</li>
<li>cherry-pick all commits by hand</li>
<li>reset the faulty rebased branch to point to the temporary branch</li>
</ol>
<p>In my current situation, this works because I can easily spot commits from both branches (one was my stuff, the other was my colleague's stuff). However, my approach strikes me as suboptimal and error-prone (let's say I had just rebased with two of my own branches).</p>
<p>Clarification: I am talking about a rebase during which <em>multiple</em> commits were replayed, not only one.</p>
","<git><rebase><git-rebase><undo>","135614","<p>The easiest way would be to find the head commit of the branch as it was immediately before the rebase started in the <a href=""https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reflog"" rel=""noreferrer"">reflog</a>...</p>

</code></pre>
<p>and to reset the current branch to it.</p>
<p>Suppose the old commit was <code>HEAD@{2}</code> in the ref log:</p>

<p>(If you do not want to retain the working copy changes, you can use <code>--hard</code> instead of <code>--soft</code>)</p>
<p>You can check the history of the candidate old head by just doing a <code>git log &quot;HEAD@{2}&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>If you've not disabled per branch reflogs you should be able to simply do <code>git reflog &quot;branchname@{1}&quot;</code> as a rebase detaches the branch head before reattaching to the final head. I would double-check this behavior, though, as I haven't verified it recently.</p>

","<git><branch><git-branch>","27185855","<h2>Simple Git 2.0+ solution:</h2>
<p>As of <strong>Git 2.0, the behavior has become simpler</strong>:</p>
<p>You can configure git with <strong><code>push.default = current</code></strong> to make life easier:</p>
<p>I added this so now I can just push a new branch upstream with</p>
<pre><code>$ git push -u
</code></pre>
<p><code>-u</code> will track remote branch of the same name. Now with this configuration, you will auto-guess the remote reference to git push. From <a href=""http://git-scm.com/docs/git-config"" rel=""noreferrer"">git.config documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>push.default</strong></p>
<p>Defines the action git push should take if no refspec is explicitly given.</p>
<p><strong><code>push.default = current</code></strong> - push the current branch to update a branch with the
same name on the receiving end. Works in both central and non-central workflows.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For me, this is a good simplification of my day-to-day Git workflow. The configuration setting takes care of the 'usual' use case where you add a branch locally and want to create it remotely. Also, I can just as easily create local branches from remotes by just doing <code>git co remote_branch_name</code> (as opposed to using <code>--set-upstream-to</code> flag).</p>
<p>I know this question and the accepted answers are rather old, but the behavior has changed so that now configuration options exist to make your workflow simpler.</p>
<p>To add to your global Git configuration, run this on the command line:</p>
<pre><code>$ git config --global push.default current

<p>Solutions for previous years, these may or may not be valid these days as the downloads page has changed significantly:</p>
<p>PREVIOUS YEARS SOLUTIONS, probably #2 is most helpful.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>You will then be prompted in a window to update Xcode Command Line tools. (which could take a while)</p>
<p>Open a new terminal window and your development tools should be returned.</p>
<p><strong>Addition:</strong> With any major or semi-major update you'll need to update the command line tools in order to get them functioning properly again. Check Xcode with any update. This goes beyond Mojave...</p>
<p><strong>After that restart your terminal</strong></p>
<p>Alternatively, <strong>IF that fails,</strong> and it might.... you'll get a pop-up box saying &quot;Software not found on server&quot;, proceed to solution 2.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>git add -A</code> stages <strong>all changes</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p><code>git add .</code> stages new files and modifications, <strong>without deletions</strong> (on the current directory and its subdirectories).</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>git add -u</code> stages modifications and deletions, <strong>without new files</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Detail:</strong></p>
<p><code>git add -A</code> is equivalent to  <code>git add .; git add -u</code>.</p>
<p>The important point about <code>git add .</code> is that it looks at the working tree and adds all those paths to the staged changes if they are either changed or are new and not ignored, it does not stage any 'rm' actions.</p>
<p><code>git add -u</code> looks at all the <em>already</em> tracked files and stages the changes to those files if they are different or if they have been removed. It does not add any new files, it only stages changes to already tracked files.</p>
<p><code>git add -A</code> is a handy shortcut for doing both of those.</p>
<p>You can test the differences out with something like this (note that for Git version 2.x your output for <code>git add .</code> <code>git status</code> <strong>will</strong> be different):</p>
<pre class=""lang-sh prettyprint-override""><code>git init
echo Change me &gt; change-me
echo Delete me &gt; delete-me
git add change-me delete-me
git commit -m initial

echo Add me &gt; add-me

<h1>Original Post</h1>
<p>You need to create a local branch that tracks a remote branch. The following command will create a local branch named <strong>daves_branch</strong>, tracking the remote branch <strong>origin/daves_branch</strong>. When you push your changes the remote branch will be updated.</p>
<p>For most recent versions of Git:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout --track origin/daves_branch
</code></pre>
<p><code>--track</code> is shorthand for <code>git checkout -b [branch] [remotename]/[branch]</code> where [remotename] is <strong>origin</strong> in this case and [branch] is twice the same, <strong>daves_branch</strong> in this case.</p>
<p>For Git 1.5.6.5 you needed this:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout --track -b daves_branch origin/daves_branch
</code></pre>
<p>For Git 1.7.2.3 and higher, this is enough (it might have started earlier, but this is the earliest confirmation I could find quickly):</p>
<pre><code>git checkout daves_branch
</code></pre>
<p>Note that with recent Git versions, this command will not create a local branch and will put you in a 'detached HEAD' state. If you want a local branch, use the <code>--track</code> option.</p>

"592620","How can I check if a program exists from a Bash script?","<p>How would I validate that a program exists, in a way that will either return an error and exit, or continue with the script?</p>

<p>It seems like it should be easy, but it's been stumping me.</p>
","<bash>","677212","<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>POSIX compatible:</p>
<pre><code>command -v &lt;the_command&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Example use:</p>
<pre><code>if ! command -v &lt;the_command&gt; &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
then
    echo &quot;&lt;the_command&gt; could not be found&quot;
    exit 1
fi
</code></pre>
<p>For Bash specific environments:</p>
<pre><code>hash &lt;the_command&gt; # For regular commands. Or...
type &lt;the_command&gt; # To check built-ins and keywords
</code></pre>
<h2>Explanation</h2>
<p>Avoid <code>which</code>. Not only is it an external process you're launching for doing very little (meaning builtins like <code>hash</code>, <code>type</code> or <code>command</code> are way cheaper), you can also rely on the builtins to actually do what you want, while the effects of external commands can easily vary from system to system.</p>
<p>Why care?</p>
<ul>
<li>Many operating systems have a <code>which</code> that <strong>doesn't even set an exit status</strong>, meaning the <code>if which foo</code> won't even work there and will <strong>always</strong> report that <code>foo</code> exists, even if it doesn't (note that some POSIX shells appear to do this for <code>hash</code> too).</li>
<li>Many operating systems make <code>which</code> do custom and evil stuff like change the output or even hook into the package manager.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, don't use <code>which</code>. Instead use one of these:</p>
<pre><code>command -v foo &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 || { echo &gt;&amp;2 &quot;I require foo but it's not installed.  Aborting.&quot;; exit 1; }
</code></pre>
<pre><code>type foo &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 || { echo &gt;&amp;2 &quot;I require foo but it's not installed.  Aborting.&quot;; exit 1; }
</code></pre>
<pre><code>hash foo 2&gt;/dev/null || { echo &gt;&amp;2 &quot;I require foo but it's not installed.  Aborting.&quot;; exit 1; }
</code></pre>
<p>(Minor side-note: some will suggest <code>2&gt;&amp;-</code> is the same <code>2&gt;/dev/null</code> but shorter – <em>this is untrue</em>.  <code>2&gt;&amp;-</code> closes FD 2 which causes an <strong>error</strong> in the program when it tries to write to stderr, which is very different from successfully writing to it and discarding the output (and dangerous!))<br />
(Additional minor side-note: some will suggest <code>&amp;&gt;/dev/null</code>, but this <a href=""https://www.shellcheck.net/wiki/SC3020"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">is not POSIX compliant</a>)</p>
<p>If your hash bang is <code>/bin/sh</code> then you should care about what POSIX says. <code>type</code> and <code>hash</code>'s exit codes aren't terribly well defined by POSIX, and <code>hash</code> is seen to exit successfully when the command doesn't exist (haven't seen this with <code>type</code> yet).  <code>command</code>'s exit status is well defined by POSIX, so that one is probably the safest to use.</p>
<p>If your script uses <code>bash</code> though, POSIX rules don't really matter anymore and both <code>type</code> and <code>hash</code> become perfectly safe to use. <code>type</code> now has a <code>-P</code> to search just the <code>PATH</code> and <code>hash</code> has the side-effect that the command's location will be hashed (for faster lookup next time you use it), which is usually a good thing since you probably check for its existence in order to actually use it.</p>
<p>As a simple example, here's a function that runs <code>gdate</code> if it exists, otherwise <code>date</code>:</p>
<pre><code>gnudate() {
    if hash gdate 2&gt;/dev/null; then
        gdate &quot;$@&quot;
    else
        date &quot;$@&quot;
    fi
}

<p>Git picks up on <code>chmod -R 777 .</code> and marks all files as changed. Is there a way to make Git ignore mode changes that have been made to files?</p>
","<git><ignore><chmod>","1580644","<p>Try:</p>
<pre><code>git config core.fileMode false
</code></pre>
<p>From <a href=""https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-config.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">git-config(1)</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>core.fileMode
    Tells Git if the executable bit of files in the working tree
    is to be honored.

    Some filesystems lose the executable bit when a file that is
    marked as executable is checked out, or checks out a
    non-executable file with executable bit on. git-clone(1)
    or git-init(1) probe the filesystem to see if it handles the 
    executable bit correctly and this variable is automatically
    set as necessary.

    A repository, however, may be on a filesystem that handles
    the filemode correctly, and this variable is set to true when
    created, but later may be made accessible from another
    environment that loses the filemode (e.g. exporting ext4
    via CIFS mount, visiting a Cygwin created repository with Git
    for Windows or Eclipse). In such a case it may be necessary
    to set this variable to false. See git-update-index(1).

    The default is true (when core.filemode is not specified
    in the config file).
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>-c</code> flag can be used to set this option for one-off commands:</p>
<pre><code>git -c core.fileMode=false diff
</code></pre>
<p>Typing the <code>-c core.fileMode=false</code> can be bothersome and so you can set this flag for all git repos or just for one git repo:</p>
<pre><code># this will set your the flag for your user for all git repos (modifies `$HOME/.gitconfig`)
# WARNING: this will be override by local config, fileMode value is automatically selected with latest version of git.
# This mean that if git detect your current filesystem is compatible it will set local core.fileMode to true when you clone or init a repository.
# Tool like cygwin emulation will be detected as compatible and so your local setting WILL BE SET to true no matter what you set in global setting.
git config --global core.fileMode false

# this will set the flag for one git repo (modifies `$current_git_repo/.git/config`)
git config core.fileMode false
</code></pre>
<p>Additionally, <code>git clone</code> and <code>git init</code> explicitly set <code>core.fileMode</code> to <code>true</code> in the repo config as discussed in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30392318/git-global-core-filemode-false-overridden-locally-on-clone"">Git global core.fileMode false overridden locally on clone</a></p>
<h2>Warning</h2>
<p><code>core.fileMode</code> is not the best practice and should be used carefully. This setting only covers the executable bit of mode and never the read/write bits. In many cases you think you need this setting because you did something like <code>chmod -R 777</code>, making all your files executable. But in most projects <strong>most files don't need and should not be executable for security reasons</strong>.</p>
<p>The proper way to solve this kind of situation is to handle folder and file permission separately, with something like:</p>
<pre class=""lang-bash prettyprint-override""><code>find . -type d -exec chmod a+rwx {} \; # Make folders traversable and read/write
find . -type f -exec chmod a+rw {} \;  # Make files read/write
</code></pre>
<p>If you do that, you'll never need to use <code>core.fileMode</code>, except in very rare environment.</p>

The file could be called anything; Git assigns no special significance to this name.</p>
<p>There is a competing convention of adding a <code>.gitignore</code> file to the empty directories to get them tracked, but some people see this as confusing since the goal is to keep the empty directories, not ignore them; <code>.gitignore</code> is also used to list files that should be ignored by Git when looking for untracked files.</p>

<p>This form is to view the changes you made relative to the index (staging area for the next commit). In other words, the differences are what you <em>could</em> tell git to further add to the index but you still haven't. You can stage these changes by using git-add(1).</p>

"89332","How do I recover a dropped stash in Git?","<p>I frequently use <code>git stash</code> and <code>git stash pop</code> to save and restore changes in my working tree. Yesterday, I had some changes in my working tree that I had stashed and popped, and then I made more changes to my working tree. I'd like to go back and review yesterday's stashed changes, but <code>git stash pop</code> appears to remove all references to the associated commit.</p>
<p>I know that if I use <code>git stash</code> then <em>.git/refs/stash contains</em> the reference of the commit used to create the stash. And <em>.git/logs/refs/stash contains</em> the whole stash. But those references are gone after <code>git stash pop</code>. I know that the commit is still in my repository somewhere, but I don't know what it was.</p>
<p>Is there an easy way to recover yesterday's stash commit reference?</p>
","<git><recovery><git-stash>","91795","<p>Once you know the hash of the stash commit you dropped, you can apply it as a stash:</p>
<pre class=""lang-bash prettyprint-override""><code>git stash apply $stash_hash
</code></pre>
<p>Or, you can create a separate branch for it with</p>
<pre class=""lang-bash prettyprint-override""><code>git branch recovered $stash_hash
</code></pre>
<p>After that, you can do whatever you want with all the normal tools. When you’re done, just blow the branch away.</p>
<h1>Finding the hash</h1>
<p>If you have only just popped it and the terminal is still open, you will <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/89332/recover-dropped-stash-in-git/7844566#7844566"">still have the hash value printed by <code>git stash pop</code> on screen</a> (thanks, Dolda).</p>
<p>Otherwise, you can find this way in Linux, Unix or Git Bash for Windows:</p>
<pre class=""lang-bash prettyprint-override""><code>git fsck --no-reflog | awk '/dangling commit/ {print $NF}'
</code></pre>
<p>… or in PowerShell for Windows:</p>
<pre class=""lang-bash prettyprint-override""><code>git fsck --no-reflog | select-string 'dangling commit' | foreach { $_.ToString().Split(&quot; &quot;)[-1] }
</code></pre>
<p>This will show you all the commits at the tips of your commit graph which are no longer referenced from any branch or tag – every lost commit, including every stash commit you’ve ever created, will be somewhere in that graph.</p>
<p>The easiest way to find the stash commit you want is probably to pass that list straight to <code>gitk</code>:</p>
<pre class=""lang-bash prettyprint-override""><code>gitk --all $( git fsck --no-reflog | awk '/dangling commit/ {print $NF}' )
</code></pre>
<p>… or in PowerShell for Windows:</p>
<pre class=""lang-bash prettyprint-override""><code>gitk --all $( git fsck --no-reflog | select-string 'dangling commit' | foreach { $_.ToString().Split(&quot; &quot;)[-1] } )
</code></pre>
<p>This will launch a repository browser showing you <em>every single commit in the repository ever</em>, regardless of whether it is reachable or not.</p>
<p>You can replace <code>gitk</code> there with something like <code>git log --graph --oneline --decorate</code> if you prefer a nice graph on the console over a separate GUI app.</p>
<p>To spot stash commits, look for commit messages of this form:</p>
<p>        WIP on <i>somebranch</i>: <i>commithash Some old commit message</i></p>

"160608","Do a ""git export"" (like ""svn export"")?","<p>I've been wondering whether there is a good &quot;git export&quot; solution that creates a copy of a tree without the <code>.git</code> repository directory. There are at least three methods I know of:</p>

<li><a href=""http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-checkout-index.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>git checkout-index</code></a> alludes to this functionality but starts with &quot;Just read the desired tree into the index...&quot; which I'm not entirely sure how to do.</li>
<li><a href=""http://code.google.com/p/git-export/"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>git-export</code></a> is a third-party script that essentially does a <code>git clone</code> into a temporary location followed by <code>rsync --exclude='.git'</code> into the final destination.</li>
</ol>
<p>None of these solutions really strike me as being satisfactory. The closest one to <code>svn export</code> might be option 1, because both require the target directory to be empty first. But option 2 seems even better, assuming I can figure out what it means to read a tree into the index.</p>

generate identical trees, regardless of intermediate dependency updates.</p>
<p><strong>This file is intended to be committed into source repositories</strong>, and serves
various purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Describe a single representation of a dependency tree such that teammates, deployments, and continuous integration are guaranteed to install exactly the same dependencies.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Provide a facility for users to &quot;time-travel&quot; to previous states of <code>node_modules</code> without having to commit the directory itself.</p>

</li>
<li><p>And optimize the installation process by allowing npm to skip repeated metadata resolutions for previously-installed packages.</p>

<p>One key detail about <code>package-lock.json</code> is that it cannot be published, and it
will be ignored if found in any place other than the toplevel package. It shares
a format with npm-shrinkwrap.json, which is essentially the same file, but
allows publication. This is not recommended unless deploying a CLI tool or
otherwise using the publication process for producing production packages.</p>

<h3>Quotes Digression</h3>
<p>Quotes can be omitted (so we can say <code>${var+x}</code> instead of <code>&quot;${var+x}&quot;</code>) because this syntax &amp; usage guarantees this will only expand to something that does not require quotes (since it either expands to <code>x</code> (which contains no word breaks so it needs no quotes), or to nothing (which results in <code>[ -z  ]</code>, which conveniently evaluates to the same value (true) that <code>[ -z &quot;&quot; ]</code> does as well)).</p>
<p>However, while quotes can be safely omitted, and it was not immediately obvious to all (it wasn't even apparent to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/2255628/destiny-architect"">the first author of this quotes explanation</a> who is also a major Bash coder), it would sometimes be better to write the solution with quotes as <code>[ -z &quot;${var+x}&quot; ]</code>, at the very small possible cost of an O(1) speed penalty.  The first author also added this as a comment next to the code using this solution giving the URL to this answer, which now also includes the explanation for why the quotes can be safely omitted.</p>

<pre><code>if [ -z &quot;$var&quot; ]; then echo &quot;var is blank&quot;; else echo &quot;var is set to '$var'&quot;; fi

<p>This is often wrong because it doesn't distinguish between a variable that is unset and a variable that is set to the empty string. That is to say, if <code>var=''</code>, then the above solution will output &quot;var is blank&quot;.</p>
<p>The distinction between unset and &quot;set to the empty string&quot; is essential in situations where the user has to specify an extension, or additional list of properties, and that not specifying them defaults to a non-empty value, whereas specifying the empty string should make the script use an empty extension or list of additional properties.</p>
<p>The distinction may not be essential in every scenario though. In those cases  <code>[ -z &quot;$var&quot; ]</code> will be just fine.</p>

<p>You can fetch all branches from all remotes like this:</p>

<li><p><code>fetch</code> will not <strong>create</strong> local branches (which <strong>track</strong> remote branches), you have to do this manually. If you want to list all remote branches:
<code>git branch -a</code></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To <strong>update</strong> local branches which track remote branches:</p>
<pre><code>git pull --all
</code></pre>
<p>However, this can be still insufficient. It will work only for your local branches which track remote branches. To track all remote branches execute this oneliner <strong>BEFORE</strong> <code>git pull --all</code>:</p>

"954560","How does Git handle symbolic links?","<p>If I have a file or directory that is a symbolic link and I commit it to a Git repository, what happens to it?</p>

<p>I would assume that it leaves it as a symbolic link until the file is deleted and then if you pull the file back from an old version it just creates a normal file.</p>

<p>What does it do when I delete the file it references? Does it just commit the dangling link?</p>
","<git><version-control><symlink>","954575","<p>From <a href=""https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/symlink.7.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">linux symlink manual</a> (assuming you are in Linux):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A symbolic link is a special type of file whose contents are a string that is the pathname of another file, the file to which the link refers.  (The contents of a symbolic link can be read using readlink(2).)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So a symbolic link is just another file, no different than a <code>README.md</code> or a <code>Makefile</code>. Git just stores the contents of the link (i.e. the aforementioned path of the file system object that it links to) in a 'blob' just like it would for any other file. It then stores the name, mode and type (including the fact that it is a symlink) in the tree object that represents its containing directory.</p>
<p>When you checkout a tree containing the link, it restores the object as a symlink regardless of whether the target file system object exists or not.</p>
<p>If you delete the file that the symlink references it doesn't affect the Git-controlled symlink in any way. You will have a dangling reference. It is up to the user to either remove or change the link to point to something valid if needed.</p>

<p>Consider upvoting that answer.</p>
<p>Note: in Git 2.19, only client-side support is implemented, server-side support is still missing, so it only works when cloning local repositories. Also note that large Git hosters, e.g. GitHub, don't actually use the Git server, they use their own implementation, so even if support shows up in the Git server, it does not automatically mean that it works on Git hosters. (On the other hand, since they don't use the Git server, they could implement it faster in their own implementations before it shows up in Git server.)</p>
<hr />
<p>No, that's not possible in Git.</p>
<p>Implementing something like this in Git would be a substantial effort and it would mean that the integrity of the client-side repository could no longer be guaranteed. If you are interested, search for discussions on &quot;sparse clone&quot; and &quot;sparse fetch&quot; on the Git mailing list.</p>
<p>In general, the consensus in the Git community is that if you have several directories that are always checked out independently, then these are really two different projects and should live in two different repositories.

<p>Is there a way I can use Git to either (a) sort the list of branches by latest commit, or (b) get a list of branches together with each one's last-commit date, in some kind of machine-readable format?</p>

<p>Worst case, I could always run <code>git branch</code> to get a list of all the branches, parse its output, and then <code>git log -n 1 branchname --format=format:%ci</code> for each one, to get each branch's commit date. But this will run on a Windows box, where spinning up a new process is relatively expensive, so launching the Git executable once per branch could get slow if there are a lot of branches.

<p>A shortcut, which doesn't depend on remembering the syntax for <code>git branch --set-upstream</code> <sup>1</sup> is to do:</p>

</code></pre>
","<git>","2531803","<h3>Short answer:</h3>
<pre class=""lang-bash prettyprint-override""><code>git reset 'HEAD@{1}'
</code></pre>
<h3>Long answer:</h3>
<p>Git keeps a log of all ref updates (e.g., checkout, reset, commit, merge). You can view it by typing:</p>
<pre><code>git reflog
</code></pre>
<p>Somewhere in this list is the commit that you lost. Let's say you just typed <code>git reset HEAD~</code> and want to undo it. My reflog looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ git reflog
3f6db14 HEAD@{0}: HEAD~: updating HEAD
d27924e HEAD@{1}: checkout: moving from d27924e0fe16776f0d0f1ee2933a0334a4787b4c
[...]
</code></pre>
<p>The first line says that <code>HEAD</code> 0 positions ago (in other words, the current position) is 3f6db14; it was obtained by resetting to <code>HEAD~</code>. The second line says that <code>HEAD</code> 1 position ago (in other words, the state before the reset) is d27924e. It was obtained by checking out a particular commit (though that's not important right now). So, to undo the reset, run <code>git reset HEAD@{1}</code> (or <code>git reset d27924e</code>).</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, you've run some other commands since then that update HEAD, the commit you want won't be at the top of the list, and you'll need to search through the <code>reflog</code>.</p>
<p>One final note: It may be easier to look at the <code>reflog</code> for the specific branch you want to un-reset, say master, rather than <code>HEAD</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ git reflog show master
c24138b master@{0}: merge origin/master: Fast-forward
90a2bf9 master@{1}: merge origin/master: Fast-forward

<p>You want to clone your repository and then use <code>git filter-branch</code> to mark everything but the subdirectory you want in your new repo to be garbage-collected.</p>

<li><p>To clone your local repository:</p>

<pre><code>git clone /XYZ /ABC
</code></pre>

<p>(Note: the repository will be cloned using hard-links, but that is not a problem since the hard-linked files will not be modified in themselves - new ones will be created.)</p></li>
<li><p>Now, let us preserve the interesting branches which we want to rewrite as well, and then remove the origin to avoid pushing there and to make sure that old commits will not be referenced by the origin:</p>

<pre><code>cd /ABC
for i in branch1 br2 br3; do git branch -t $i origin/$i; done
git remote rm origin
</code></pre>

<p>or for all remote branches:</p>

<pre><code>cd /ABC
for i in $(git branch -r | sed ""s/.*origin\///""); do git branch -t $i origin/$i; done
git remote rm origin
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Now you might want to also remove tags which have no relation with the subproject; you can also do that later, but you might need to prune your repo again. I did not do so and got a <code>WARNING: Ref 'refs/tags/v0.1' is unchanged</code> for all tags (since they were all unrelated to the subproject); additionally, after removing such tags more space will be reclaimed. Apparently <code>git filter-branch</code> should be able to rewrite other tags, but I could not verify this. If you want to remove all tags, use <code>git tag -l | xargs git tag -d</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Then use filter-branch and reset to exclude the other files, so they can be pruned. Let's also add <code>--tag-name-filter cat --prune-empty</code> to remove empty commits and to rewrite tags (note that this will have to strip their signature):</p>

<pre><code>git filter-branch --tag-name-filter cat --prune-empty --subdirectory-filter ABC -- --all
</code></pre>

<p>or alternatively, to only rewrite the HEAD branch and ignore tags and other branches:</p>

<pre><code>git filter-branch --tag-name-filter cat --prune-empty --subdirectory-filter ABC HEAD
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Then delete the backup reflogs so the space can be truly reclaimed (although now the operation is destructive)</p>

<pre><code>git reset --hard
git for-each-ref --format=""%(refname)"" refs/original/ | xargs -n 1 git update-ref -d
git reflog expire --expire=now --all
git gc --aggressive --prune=now
</code></pre>

<p>and now you have a local git repository of the ABC sub-directory with all its history preserved. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Note: For most uses, <code>git filter-branch</code> should indeed have the added parameter <code>-- --all</code>. Yes that's really <kbd>-</kbd><kbd>-</kbd><kbd>space</kbd><kbd>-</kbd><kbd>-</kbd> <code>all</code>.  This needs to be the last parameters for the command.

<pre><code>while true; do

"6217156","Break a previous commit into multiple commits","<p>Without creating a branch and doing a bunch of funky work on a new branch, is it possible to break a single commit into a few different commits after it's been committed to the local repository?</p>

<p>First, start with a clean working directory: <code>git status</code> should show no pending modifications, deletions, or additions.</p>
<p>Now, you have to decide which commit(s) you want to split.</p>
<h3>A) Splitting the most recent commit</h3>
<p>To split apart your most recent commit, first:</p>
<pre><code>$ git reset HEAD~
</code></pre>
<p>Now commit the pieces individually in the usual way, producing as many commits as you need.</p>
<h3>B) Splitting a commit farther back</h3>
<p>This requires <em>rebasing</em>, that is, rewriting history. To specify the correct commit, you have several choices:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If it is three commits back, then</p>
<pre><code>  $ git rebase -i HEAD~3
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>3</code> is how many commits back it is.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If it is farther back in the tree than you want to count, then</p>
<pre><code>  $ git rebase -i 123abcd~
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>123abcd</code> is the SHA1 of the commit you want to split up.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you want to rebase the entire current branch simply do:</p>
<pre><code>  $ git rebase -i

</li>
<li><p>If you are on a different branch (e.g., a feature branch) that you want to merge into <code>master</code>:</p>
<pre><code>  $ git rebase -i master
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When you get the rebase edit screen, find the commit you want to break apart.  At the beginning of that line, replace <code>pick</code> with <code>edit</code> (<code>e</code> for short).  Save the buffer and exit.  Rebase will now stop just after the commit you want to edit.  Then:</p>
<pre><code>$ git reset HEAD~
</code></pre>
<p>Commit the pieces individually in the usual way, producing as many commits as you need.</p>
<p>Finally</p>

<p>Here is a snippet</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Formatting and Whitespace</strong></p>
  
  <p>Formatting and whitespace issues are some of the more frustrating and
  subtle problems that many developers encounter when collaborating,
  especially cross-platform. It’s very easy for patches or other
  collaborated work to introduce subtle whitespace changes because
  editors silently introduce them, and if your files ever touch a
  Windows system, their line endings might be replaced. Git has a few
  configuration options to help with these issues.</p>

<pre><code>core.autocrlf
</code></pre>
  
  <p>If you’re programming on Windows and working with people who are not
  (or vice-versa), you’ll probably run into line-ending issues at some
  point. This is because Windows uses both a carriage-return character
  and a linefeed character for newlines in its files, whereas Mac and
  Linux systems use only the linefeed character. This is a subtle but
  incredibly annoying fact of cross-platform work; many editors on
  Windows silently replace existing LF-style line endings with CRLF, or
  insert both line-ending characters when the user hits the enter key.</p>
  
  <p>Git can handle this by auto-converting CRLF line endings into LF when
  you add a file to the index, and vice versa when it checks out code
  onto your filesystem. You can turn on this functionality with the
  core.autocrlf setting. If you’re on a Windows machine, set it to true
  – this converts LF endings into CRLF when you check out code:</p>

<pre><code>$ git config --global core.autocrlf true
</code></pre>
  
  <p>If you’re on a Linux or Mac system that uses LF line endings, then you
  don’t want Git to automatically convert them when you check out files;
  however, if a file with CRLF endings accidentally gets introduced,
  then you may want Git to fix it. You can tell Git to convert CRLF to
  LF on commit but not the other way around by setting core.autocrlf to
  input:</p>

<pre><code>$ git config --global core.autocrlf input
</code></pre>
  
  <p>This setup should leave you with CRLF endings in Windows checkouts,
  but LF endings on Mac and Linux systems and in the repository.</p>
  
  <p>If you’re a Windows programmer doing a Windows-only project, then you
  can turn off this functionality, recording the carriage returns in the
  repository by setting the config value to false:</p>

<pre><code>$ git config --global core.autocrlf false
</code></pre>

"449541","How can I selectively merge or pick changes from another branch in Git?","<p>I'm using Git on a new project that has two parallel -- but currently experimental -- development branches:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>master</code>: import of existing codebase plus a few modifications that I'm generally sure of</li>
<li><code>exp1</code>: experimental branch #1</li>
<li><code>exp2</code>: experimental branch #2</li>
</ul>
<p><code>exp1</code> and <code>exp2</code> represent two very different architectural approaches. Until I get further along I have no way of knowing which one (if either) will work. As I make progress in one branch I sometimes have edits that would be useful in the other branch and would like to merge just those.</p>
<p><strong>What is the best way to merge selective changes from one development branch to another while leaving behind everything else?</strong></p>
<p>Approaches I've considered:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><code>git merge --no-commit</code> followed by manual unstaging of a large number of edits that I don't want to make common between the branches.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Manual copying of common files into a temporary directory followed by <code>git checkout</code> to move to the other branch and then more manual copying out of the temporary directory into the working tree.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A variation on the above. Abandon the <code>exp</code> branches for now and use two additional local repositories for experimentation.  This makes the manual copying of files much more straightforward.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All three of these approaches seem tedious and error-prone.  I'm hoping there is a better approach; something akin to a filter path parameter that would make <code>git-merge</code> more selective.</p>

"5772192","How can I reconcile detached HEAD with master/origin?","<p>I'm new at the branching complexities of Git. I always work on a single branch and commit changes and then periodically push to my remote origin.</p>

<p>Somewhere recently, I did a reset of some files to get them out of commit staging, and later did a <code>rebase -i</code> to get rid of a couple recent local commits. Now I'm in a state I don't quite understand.</p>

<p>In my working area, <code>git log</code> shows exactly what I'd expect-- I'm on the right train with the commits I didn't want gone, and new ones there, etc.</p>

<p>But I just pushed to the remote repository, and what's there is different-- a couple of the commits I'd killed in the rebase got pushed, and the new ones committed locally aren't there. </p>

<p>I think ""master/origin"" is detached from HEAD, but I'm not 100% clear on what that means, how to visualize it with the command line tools, and how to fix it.</p>
","<git>","5772882","<p>First, let’s clarify <a href=""https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-References"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>what HEAD is</strong></a> and what it means when it is detached.  </p>

<p>HEAD is the symbolic name for the currently checked out commit. When HEAD is not detached (the “normal”<sup>1</sup> situation: you have a branch checked out), HEAD actually points to a branch’s “ref” and the branch points to the commit. HEAD is thus “attached” to a branch. When you make a new commit, the branch that HEAD points to is updated to point to the new commit. HEAD follows automatically since it just points to the branch.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>git symbolic-ref HEAD</code> yields <code>refs/heads/master</code><br>
The branch named “master” is checked out.</li>
<li><code>git rev-parse refs/heads/master</code> yield <code>17a02998078923f2d62811326d130de991d1a95a</code><br>
That commit is the current tip or “head” of the master branch.</li>
<li><code>git rev-parse HEAD</code> also yields <code>17a02998078923f2d62811326d130de991d1a95a</code><br>
This is what it means to be a “symbolic ref”. It points to an object through some other reference.<br>
(Symbolic refs were originally implemented as symbolic links, but later changed to plain files with extra interpretation so that they could be used on platforms that do not have symlinks.)</li>
</ul>

<p>We have <code>HEAD</code> → <code>refs/heads/master</code> → <code>17a02998078923f2d62811326d130de991d1a95a</code></p>

<p>When HEAD is detached, it points directly to a commit—instead of indirectly pointing to one through a branch. You can think of a detached HEAD as being on an unnamed branch. </p>

<ul>
<li><code>git symbolic-ref HEAD</code> fails with <code>fatal: ref HEAD is not a symbolic ref</code></li>
<li><code>git rev-parse HEAD</code> yields <code>17a02998078923f2d62811326d130de991d1a95a</code><br>
Since it is not a symbolic ref, it must point directly to the commit itself.</li>
</ul>

<p>We have <code>HEAD</code> → <code>17a02998078923f2d62811326d130de991d1a95a</code></p>

<p>The important thing to remember with a detached HEAD is that if the commit it points to is otherwise unreferenced (no other ref can reach it), then it will become “dangling” when you checkout some other commit. Eventually, such dangling commits will be pruned through the garbage collection process (by default, they are kept for at least 2 weeks and may be kept longer by being referenced by HEAD’s reflog).</p>

<p><sup>1</sup>
It is perfectly fine to do “normal” work with a detached HEAD, you just have to keep track of what you are doing to avoid having to fish dropped history out of the reflog.</p>

<hr>

<p>The intermediate steps of an interactive rebase are done with a detached HEAD (partially to avoid polluting the active branch’s reflog). If you finish the full rebase operation, it will update your original branch with the cumulative result of the rebase operation and reattach HEAD to the original branch. My guess is that you never fully completed the rebase process; this will leave you with a detached HEAD pointing to the commit that was most recently processed by the rebase operation.</p>

<p>To recover from your situation, you should create a branch that points to the commit currently pointed to by your detached HEAD:</p>

<pre><code>git branch temp
git checkout temp
</code></pre>

<p><sub>(these two commands can be abbreviated as <code>git checkout -b temp</code>)</sub></p>

<p>This will reattach your HEAD to the new <code>temp</code> branch.</p>

<p>Next, you should compare the current commit (and its history) with the normal branch on which you expected to be working:</p>

<pre><code>git log --graph --decorate --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit master origin/master temp
git diff master temp
git diff origin/master temp
</code></pre>

<p>(You will probably want to experiment with the log options: add <code>-p</code>, leave off <code>--pretty=…</code> to see the whole log message, etc.)</p>

<p>If your new <code>temp</code> branch looks good, you may want to update (e.g.) <code>master</code> to point to it:</p>

<pre><code>git branch -f master temp
git checkout master
</code></pre>

<p><sub>(these two commands can be abbreviated as <code>git checkout -B master temp</code>)</sub></p>

<p>You can then delete the temporary branch:</p>

<pre><code>git branch -d temp
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, you will probably want to push the reestablished history:</p>

<pre><code>git push origin master
</code></pre>

<p>You may need to add <code>--force</code> to the end of this command to push if the remote branch can not be “fast-forwarded” to the new commit (i.e. you dropped, or rewrote some existing commit, or otherwise rewrote some bit of history).</p>

<p>If you were in the middle of a rebase operation you should probably clean it up. You can check whether a rebase was in process by looking for the directory <code>.git/rebase-merge/</code>. You can manually clean up the in-progress rebase by just deleting that directory (e.g. if you no longer remember the purpose and context of the active rebase operation). Usually you would use <code>git rebase --abort</code>, but that does some extra resetting that you probably want to avoid (it moves HEAD back to the original branch and resets it back to the original commit, which will undo some of the work we did above).</p>

","<git><commit><git-revert>","1470452","<p><em>Expanding what I wrote in a comment</em></p>
<p>The general rule is that you should not rewrite (change) history that you have published, because somebody might have based their work on it.  If you rewrite (change) history, you would make problems with merging their changes and with updating for them.</p>
<p>So the solution is to create a <em>new commit</em> which <strong>reverts changes</strong> that you want to get rid of.  You can do this using <a href=""http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-revert.html"" rel=""noreferrer"" title=""git-revert(1) Manual Page - Revert an existing commit"">git revert</a> command.</p>

</pre>
<p>(arrows here refers to the direction of the pointer: the &quot;parent&quot; reference in the case of commits, the top commit in the case of branch head (branch ref), and the name of branch in the case of HEAD reference).</p>
<p>What you need to create is the following:</p>
<pre>
A &lt;-- B  &lt;-- C &lt;-- D &lt;-- [(BCD)<sup>-1</sup>]                   &lt;-- master &lt;-- HEAD
</pre>
<p>where <code>[(BCD)^-1]</code> means the commit that reverts changes in commits B, C, D.  Mathematics tells us that (BCD)<sup>-1</sup> = D<sup>-1</sup> C<sup>-1</sup> B<sup>-1</sup>, so you can get the required situation using the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>$ git revert --no-commit D
$ git revert --no-commit C
$ git revert --no-commit B
$ git commit -m &quot;the commit message for all of them&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Works for everything except merge commits.</p>

"8981194","Changing git commit message after push (given that no one pulled from remote)","<p>I have made a git commit and subsequent push. I would like to change the commit message. If I understand correctly, this is not advisable because someone might have pulled from the remote repository before I make such changes. What if I know that no one has pulled? </p>

<p>Is there a way to do this?</p>
","<git><push><commit>","8981216","<h3>Changing history</h3>

<p>If it is the most recent commit, you can simply do this:</p>

<pre><code>git commit --amend
</code></pre>

<p>This brings up the editor with the last commit message and lets you edit the message.  (You can use <code>-m</code> if you want to wipe out the old message and use a new one.)</p>

<h3>Pushing</h3>

<p>And then when you push, do this:</p>

<pre><code>git push --force-with-lease &lt;repository&gt; &lt;branch&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Or you can use ""+"":</p>

<pre><code>git push &lt;repository&gt; +&lt;branch&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Or you can use <code>--force</code>:</p>

<pre><code>git push --force &lt;repository&gt; &lt;branch&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Be careful when using these commands.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If someone else pushed changes to the same branch, you probably want to avoid destroying those changes.  The <code>--force-with-lease</code> option is the safest, because it will abort if there are any upstream changes (</p></li>
<li><p>If you don't specify the branch explicitly, Git will use the default push settings.  If your default push setting is ""matching"", then you may destroy changes on several branches at the same time. </p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Pulling / fetching afterwards</h3>

<p>Anyone who already pulled will now get an error message, and they will need to update (assuming they aren't making any changes themselves) by doing something like this:</p>

<pre><code>git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/master # Loses local commits
</code></pre>

<p>Be careful when using <code>reset --hard</code>.  If you have changes to the branch, those changes will be destroyed.</p>

<h3>A note about modifying history</h3>

<p>The destroyed data is really just the old commit message, but <code>--force</code> doesn't know that, and will happily delete other data too.  So think of <code>--force</code> as ""I want to destroy data, and I know for sure what data is being destroyed.""  But when the destroyed data is committed, you can often recover old commits from the reflog—the data is actually <em>orphaned</em> instead of destroyed (although orphaned commits are periodically deleted).</p>

<p>If you don't think you're destroying data, then stay away from <code>--force</code>... <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13036947/10-git-lines-erased-8gb-form-my-pc-how-to-get-them-back/13037141"">bad things might happen</a>.</p>

<p>This is why <code>--force-with-lease</code> is somewhat safer.</p>

You don't need to use the whole name:</p>
<pre><code>git log --author=&quot;Jon&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>will match a commit made by &quot;Jonathan Smith&quot;</p>
<pre><code>git log --author=Jon
</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code>git log --author=Smith
</code></pre>
<p>would also work. The quotes are optional if you don't need any spaces.</p>
<p><strong>Add <code>--all</code> if you intend to search all branches and not just the current commit's ancestors in your repo.</strong></p>
<p>You can also easily match on multiple authors as regex is the underlying mechanism for this filter. So to list commits by Jonathan or Adam, you can do this:</p>
<pre><code>git log --author=&quot;\(Adam\)\|\(Jon\)&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>In order to exclude commits by a particular author or set of authors using regular expressions as noted <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/406230/regular-expression-to-match-string-not-containing-a-word"">in this question</a>, you can use a <a href=""http://www.regular-expressions.info/lookaround.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">negative lookahead</a> in combination with the <code>--perl-regexp</code> switch:</p>
<pre><code>git log --author='^(?!Adam|Jon).*$' --perl-regexp
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, you can exclude commits authored by Adam by using <code>bash</code> and piping:</p>
<pre><code>git log --format='%H %an' | 
  grep -v Adam | 
  cut -d ' ' -f1 | 
  xargs -n1 git log -1
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to exclude commits commited (but not necessarily authored) by Adam, replace <code>%an</code> with <code>%cn</code>.
